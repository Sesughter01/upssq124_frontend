<!-- WHAT IS HTML IS -->

<!-- HTML works with features called elements 
      An element is a group of characters that are described by 
      1. Opening tag
      2. Content - This could just text or other elements
      3. Closing tag

      However there are certain html elements that don't strictly follow this rule 
      for instance the image has only one tag 

-->
<!-- HTML TAGS 
     HTML tags are characters or text that are enclosed in angle brackets
     typically (opening) they begin with a left-hand angle bracket , some text in-between and
      end with a right-hand angle bracket.
      Note that a closing tag has a forward slash immdiately after the left-hand angle
-->

<!-- HTML ATTRIBUTES 
      Attributes provide more information about html elements
      Attributes are always specified in the start tag(for elements that have opening and closing tags) in single tag 
      elements you add the attributes inside the tag
      Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
